# LGTM Enterprise extension for Visual Studio

This repository contains [binary releases](https://github.com/Semmle/lgtm-visualstudio-binaries/releases) of the Visual Studio extension for LGTM Enterprise. **Please note that use of the LGTM Enterprise application and its IDE extensions requires a separate license agreement with GitHub.**

For more information or assistance with this product, please refer to the LGTM Enterprise help.

Note that this plugin is designed to work with [Microsoft Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), not to be confused with [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/). There is no extension to display LGTM alerts in 
VSCode to LGTM Enterprise, but there is a [VSCode extension for writing and running CodeQL queries](https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql).
